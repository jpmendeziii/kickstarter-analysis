The mean successful percentage is 61.29% for all months, and the months of May and June also show the highest percentage of successful outcomes with 66.87% and 65.36%, respectfully.
Technically, May, June and July along with October shows the most failed outcomes by raw data due to sheer volume - however a closer look reveals that by percentage December has the highest percentage of failed outcomes at 46.67%.  This is statistically significant because the mean failure rate is 36.01% +/- 7.64% standard deviation for all months, which means the month of December is above the mean failure rate by 1.4x standard deviation.
